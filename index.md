## Research Projects

### [Population-Free Distribution Percentile Estimator](https://github.com/anyfruit/Population-Free-Distribution-Percentile-Estimator)
##### Position: Undergraduate Researcher, Advisor: Dr. Matthew Moore
Monte-Carlo simulation is a computational technique that uses repeated random sampling to estimate the probabilistic outcomes of a process. This research introduces a methodology for estimating percentiles of distribution-free populations by using Monte-Carlo simulations to reproduce percentiles, and Beta distribution to approximate the simulation outputs to provide generalization of percentile estimations for most distribution-free populations.

### [Flexible Attentional Focus Shifting During Dual-Tasks: Effects of Texting While Walking on Gait and Cognition](https://github.com/anyfruit/TWWT-Project)
##### Position: Undergraduate Research Assistant, Advisor: Chi Whan Choi & Dr. Simone Gill
The study uses various tasks such as normal walking, walking with obstacles, and walking while texting to assess the impact on gait and cognitive functions. The hypothesis is tested through different scenarios, including walking with low, medium, and high obstacles, while performing cognitive tasks like copying and answering questions. The research aims to understand how habitual dual tasks like walking while texting could affect cognitive and motor performance, and whether the difficulty of these tasks affects attention allocation.

### [Factors Contributing to Whether or not People With Obesity Undergo Bariatric Surgery](https://github.com/anyfruit/Factors-Affecting-Likelihood-of-Undergoing-Bariatric-Surgery)
##### Position: Undergraduate Research Assistant, Advisor: Chi Whan Choi & Dr. Simone Gill
Bariatric surgery has been suggested as a safe and effective way to treat obesity by facilitating weight loss, but factors that predict the likelihood of bariatric surgery are unknown. The objective of this study was to describe factors associated with individuals with obesity that influence their decision to undergo bariatric surgery.

### [Mixed effect model of the Virtual Obstacle Program](https://github.com/anyfruit/Mediation-Analysis-Virtual-Obstacle-Program)
##### Position: Undergraduate Research Assistant, Advisor: Chi Whan Choi & Dr. Simone Gill
Obesity poses unique challenges for individuals’ static and dynamic stability. Compared to individuals with normal body mass index (BMI), individuals with obesity use different movement strategies such as increasing step width or hip flexion when walking or crossing obstacles, which often lead to falls and injuries.These strategies may be linked to postural instability or motor planning dysfunction (MPD) that can result in slowed information processing. Studies have investigated movement strategies in standing, but strategies in sitting have not been well documented.

### [Analyzing and Predicting Wordle: A Multi-Model Approach to Difficulty and Number of Reports Prediction](https://github.com/anyfruit/wordle)
