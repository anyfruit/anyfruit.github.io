## Bio
I'm a senior at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/) majoring in Statistics and minoring in Computer Science, I am passionate about using data and technology to drive insights and solutions. With a strong foundation in statistical analysis and programming languages such as Python and R, I am well-equipped to tackle complex data-driven problems.

Currently, I am a research assistant working at the [Motor Development Lab](https://www.bu.edu/motordevlab/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Simone Gill and her PhD student Chi Whan Choi. I am also a member of the MOCOVI Research Group led by [Dr. Matthew Moore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-n-moore-313375113/). My research interest focus on theoretical statistical analysis and applying statistical and machine learning-related concepts into health-related research topics.

Beyond research experience, I also had an internship experience as a Digital Redesign Consultant in the Automotive team at [PwC Advisory](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting.html). You can find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RYVq79_1_wDPOr8aFPBx0_ZUpgpNinXO/view?usp=sharing).

## Research Projects

### [Population-Free Distribution Percentile Estimator](https://github.com/anyfruit/Population-Free-Distribution-Percentile-Estimator)
##### Position: Undergraduate Researcher, Advisor: Dr. Matthew Moore
Monte-Carlo simulation is a computational technique that uses repeated random sampling to estimate the probabilistic outcomes of a process. This research introduces a methodology for estimating percentiles of distribution-free populations by using Monte-Carlo simulations to reproduce percentiles, and Beta distribution to approximate the simulation outputs to provide generalization of percentile estimations for most distribution-free populations.

### [Flexible Attentional Focus Shifting During Dual-Tasks: Effects of Texting While Walking on Gait and Cognition](https://github.com/anyfruit/TWWT-Project)
##### Position: Undergraduate Research Assistant, Advisor: Chi Whan Choi & Dr. Simone Gill
The study uses various tasks such as normal walking, walking with obstacles, and walking while texting to assess the impact on gait and cognitive functions. The hypothesis is tested through different scenarios, including walking with low, medium, and high obstacles, while performing cognitive tasks like copying and answering questions. The research aims to understand how habitual dual tasks like walking while texting could affect cognitive and motor performance, and whether the difficulty of these tasks affects attention allocation.

### [Factors Contributing to Whether or not People With Obesity Undergo Bariatric Surgery](https://github.com/anyfruit/Factors-Affecting-Likelihood-of-Undergoing-Bariatric-Surgery)
##### Position: Undergraduate Research Assistant, Advisor: Chi Whan Choi & Dr. Simone Gill
Bariatric surgery has been suggested as a safe and effective way to treat obesity by facilitating weight loss, but factors that predict the likelihood of bariatric surgery are unknown. The objective of this study was to describe factors associated with individuals with obesity that influence their decision to undergo bariatric surgery.

### [Mixed effect model of the Virtual Obstacle Program](https://github.com/anyfruit/Mediation-Analysis-Virtual-Obstacle-Program)
##### Position: Undergraduate Research Assistant, Advisor: Chi Whan Choi & Dr. Simone Gill
Obesity poses unique challenges for individualsâ€™ static and dynamic stability. Compared to individuals with normal body mass index (BMI), individuals with obesity use different movement strategies such as increasing step width or hip flexion when walking or crossing obstacles, which often lead to falls and injuries.These strategies may be linked to postural instability or motor planning dysfunction (MPD) that can result in slowed information processing. Studies have investigated movement strategies in standing, but strategies in sitting have not been well documented.

### [Analyzing and Predicting Wordle: A Multi-Model Approach to Difficulty and Number of Reports Prediction](https://github.com/anyfruit/wordle)
##### Project for MCM 2023, With [Khanh Nguyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khanhnguyen98/)
This paper aims to analyze and predict aspects of the Wordle game, employing a multi-model approach. It uses a Multiple Linear Regression Model to determine word difficulty, a Piecewise Curve Fitting Method for predicting player report trends, and a Monte-Carlo Simulation to anticipate future game outcomes. Additionally, it presents a data-driven strategy for winning at Wordle. These models collectively enhance understanding of Wordle's gameplay dynamics and player engagement.

### [Automated Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-Rays Using CNN-Based Image Segmentation](https://github.com/anyfruit/Pneumonia-Detection)
##### Independent Project
This project develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the automatic detection of pneumonia in chest X-ray images. Utilizing the "Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)" dataset from Kaggle, the study focuses on constructing and training a CNN model to distinguish between normal and pneumonia-affected X-rays. The model's architecture comprises convolutional and max-pooling layers, culminating in a dense layer for binary classification. Emphasizing the benefits of CNNs, such as automated feature learning and spatial information processing, the project aims to improve the accuracy and speed of pneumonia diagnosis, contributing significantly to enhanced healthcare outcomes.

## Course Projects

### [An Analysis of Factors Influencing 2008 BMW Auction Prices](https://github.com/anyfruit/BMW-Pricing)
##### Course Project for MA 575 Linear Models, Course Instructor: Professor Julio Castrillon
This project aims to investigate the factors that affect the price of used BMW cars sold at auction in 2008 using multiple linear regression principles. In this study, 14 selected predictor variables are used to predict the auction price based on detailed reasons and background interests. Diagnostic methods such as scatter plots, standardized residual plots, and partial F-tests are deployed to test the appropriateness of the constructed model. The results of this study may provide valuable insights into the factors that influence the selling price of used BMW cars.

### [Predict Pricing of Rental Properties on Airbnb](https://github.com/anyfruit/Predict-Pricing-of-Rental-Properties-on-Airbnb)
##### Course Project for CS 541 Applied Machine Learning, Course Instructor: Professor Bryan Plummer
Pricing a rental property such as an apartment or house on Airbnb is a difficult challenge. A model that accurately predicts the price can potentially help renters and hosts on the platform make better decisions. In this assignment, your task is to train a model that takes features of a listing as input and predicts the price.

### [Web-Based Software: Recipe Finder](https://github.com/HanyuQiu/CS411--7)
##### Course Project for CS 411 Software Engineering, Course Instructor: Professor Perry Donham
Picky eaters always avoid certain foods or dishes, but sometimes the dishes they can cook with their favorite ingredients may be limited. In such cases, this web-based software helps them to find available food and avoid using ingredients they don't like, as the software generates recipes based on the ingredients that are available/disliked.
